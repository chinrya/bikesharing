# Bikesharing

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the aggregate data of bikeshare users throughout the month of August. To start with, we are able to see a very general breakdown of the demographic, organized by gender type and customer type.

As you can see, the vast majority of consumers are male subscribers, which is important information for a business to know, in order to know where they would need to maintain healthy relations with to keep income rolling in.

If one wants to fix up their bikes, the best time to do so seems to be in the very early morning times, avoiding the peak times around 4:00 to 7:00 PM.

Using these two graphs, it shows there's a huge dropoff in bikerides after 10 minutes, with basically 0 from any time after 45 minutes of the first hour. It is also easy to see that any gender follows this trend, with all graphs regarding gender following the same pattern, just with different volumes of users.

Very similar to the last set of graphs, just in a different visual mode, the heatmaps show there isn't much difference in horus of usage between genders, besides more males using the bikes during peak hours, though that is expected due to males being the majority of users.

This final graph just locks in the difference in volume between the genders, but also helps highlight that the heaviest usage is during the weekdays, one could assume being used as transportation to and from work possibly.

# Summary

In conclusion it seems that during the weekdays, primarily during 4-7 PM, bikesharing is at its peak, with largely male users, though there is a decent amount of female users. One additional visualization I believe would be benificial towards future studies would be a map of pathing, to see if there are high-concentration points in which something could be set up for convenience, some sort of communal bike maintanence stations or something of the like. Another visualization could be some sort of pie chart that shows who is using the bikeshare for which purposes, such as getting to work, recreation, or other. This could help narrow down specifics for bringing in new clientelle, like deals for certain companies who have a lot of employees that actively use bikesharing or something of the sort.
